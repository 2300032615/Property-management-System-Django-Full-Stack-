# The ER Model
The basic purpose of the conceptual ER model is then to establish structural metadata com-
monality for the master data entities between the set of logical ER models. The conceptual data
model is used to form commonality relationships between ER models as a basis for data model
integration.

### Entitities
The above ER model is designed with two fundamental
entities:
1. **Properties** - The properties or the assets are one of the basic entities on which the system is
being built upon. The various attributes are so chosen to get the clear recognizable property
of the userâ€™s desired as and when required. The Prop.ID will uniquely identify the specific
property or the asset from the database along with the complete details that includes its
establishment date and the managing staff for the particular property. The property entity
has been framed with the following attributes:
    * Prop. ID
    * Property Name
    * Location
    * Establishment Date
    * Description
